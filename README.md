# OgreBilliards
Repository for the CS-48101-002-201810: Game Engine Concepts course.

## Description
Add additional functionalites to the Ogre Billiards game in GPG. 

### Overall Goals
1.	Add a scratch feature that allows the player to place the cue ball where ever they want on the table.  As opposed to just having the cue ball go back to the starting position. 
2.	Add a function to make the player have consecutive turns if they get a ball of their type in a pocket. 
3.	Add a pool cue so that it looks more natural.
4.	Add a restart function to make it easier for the player to continue playing after a win or loss.
5.	Adding a better rigidbody to the balls for an enhanced physic effect when balls collide.
6.	To give the game a more realistic look we will also be changing the ball appearances so that there are solids and stripes instead of red and yellow. 
7.	Add a function where if the eight ball goes in a pocket and that player has not scored all their balls yet they will lose. 
8.	Change how the players are called so it will be player1 and player2 instead of red and yellow.  This will also allow the player who get the first ball or balls in to determine whether they want to be stripes or solids.
